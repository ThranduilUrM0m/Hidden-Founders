PS : this is my final project for the Challenge.

I first made a basic project with only html css js, no tools included.

and for this basic's project log please refer to : [Hidden-Founders-Basic](https://github.com/ThranduilUrM0m/Hidden-Founders-Basic.git)

and so when satisfied with the basic views i set up a **react starter** project, in which i took the view from the basic project and divided it to components and set them up directly in this final project.

so in the log u might find it odd that it took too little time to be finished, but as i mentioned, the basic views were made separetly in the basic project *see link above*
